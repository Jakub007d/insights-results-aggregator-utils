"""Converts outputs from OCP rule engine into proper reports.

All input files that have filename 's_*.json' (usually anonymized
outputs from OCP rule engine') are converted into proper 'report'
that can be:

    1. Published into Kafka topic
    2. Stored directly into aggregator database

It is done by inserting organization ID, clusterName and lastChecked
attributes and by rearranging output structure. Output files will
have following names: 'r_*.json'.
