Prepares script to cleanup old results from database.

Description:
-----------

This script can be used to analyze data exported from `report` table by
the following command typed into PSQL console:

    \\copy report to 'reports.csv' csv

Script retrieves all reports older than the specified amount of time represented as days.
Then it creates an SQL script that can be run by administrator against selected database.

Database connection:
-------------------
Howto connect to PSQL console:

    psql -h host

Password can be retrieved from OpenShift console, for example from:
ccx-data-pipeline-qa/browse/secrets/ccx-data-pipeline-db
ccx-data-pipeline-prod/browse/secrets/ccx-data-pipeline-db

Usage:
------
    cleanup_old_results.py offset_in_days input_file.csv > cleanup.sql

Example:
-------
create a script to cleanup all records older than 90 days

    cleanup_old_results.py 90 report.csv > cleanup.sql
